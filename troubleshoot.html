Welcome to BlueNebula, thanks for using this! Just so you know, if a page isn’t loading, that is not our fault. Blame Render or the server might be down. The reason it’s not loading is because the website is too big in memory or CPU, and the server doesn’t respond. Stick with basic sites, please, and have fun! another thing, if it blocks the proxy when you have bluenebula proxy just remember that UrlFinder is built into it so scrool to the bottom to change the method and when you want to load games/scripts use urlfinder. also when you put /discord in that text box it will bring you to the BlueNebula discord server where you can make slt links and if you need help the best method is downloading the file so it will work without any website needed. more shortcuts will be added soon
